``Hey, kiddo. Just know, I'm still here.''

She sat by his bedside in the chair from his desk. The chair was worn from decades of use, but she couldn't find the time to tear herself away from his bedside to go get a new one, and the kitchen seemed so far away. What if he woke up while she wasn't there? What would happen then? She had always been there to greet him when he woke.

His face was still, soft, unmoving. How long had she been out before he had to skip? Even though it was clearly her son, she could sense his distress.

``You must have been so scared, little king. I'm sorry for putting you through that.''

She brought his hand up to her face and snuggled it against her cheek. It was warm, but it was no longer the hand of a little child. He had grown into a man.

\textit{When did my boy grow up? At least I was able to be part of all of it.}

Reminiscing on the times he was little, a small smile made its way to the corners of her mouth.

``I suppose now that you're a man, I owe you some answers. You asked a lot of hard questions when you were little.''

It was hard for her to think about the earlier years of her life. They seemed so distant.

``How about we start with your dad. You never knew him, but Tom loved you as much as any man was capable. That's right, his name was Tom; Thomas Jacobsen.

``He was an incredibly generous and soft-spoken man, which was quite strange back in that day.''

Looking at the corner of his room, like something was there, she tried remembering more details to impart.

``When was it that we met? It was... sometime in the late 1800s, I think. It was a very long time ago.''

She chuckled to herself. ``I suppose some things are easier to remember than others when they're that long ago.''

Thinking about her past, she shuddered at the simplest thought of some of her demons.

Shaking her head, she brought her attention back to her story and her son. ``Oh I remember, it was 1895. To that, I hear you ask, `1895!? There's no way that can be right!' To which, I tell you, I may look young, but I am certainly not. I've been around the block, not just a few times, but enough times to remember when the block had dinosaurs!''

\textit{What am I saying? Nonsensical rambling. Though, what else am I to do? I should keep talking to him in case he can hear me.}

``But, your dad, he was so handsome and young. When we met he was about twenty-three years old. I think we met at the local butcher shop. He was ordering what seemed like an entire cow.

``A wry comment from myself got his attention and we began talking. It turned out that he was a manager at the local malt liquor brewery and was buying some things to help out a few of the local families that had landed on hard times.

``That kind of generosity was unheard of back then. Largely, people were so cut-throat, trying to get ahead in any way that they could. The American Dream is all they wanted, granted, not nearly as much as when the Louisiana Purchase opened up. That's a story for another...''

She cut herself off before she promised a recount of that story. She clenched her stomach as if some wound there had never healed.

``Let's just say that people were blinded by all sorts of demons; ambitions and aspirations. And yes, your old mom was there for that too.'' Her body ached, her head pounded, and her feet felt cold.

\textit{Maybe I should turn on the heat... No, there's no sense in wasting energy. He doesn't respond to temperature when he's skipping. As long as it's comfortable when he wakes up. That's all that's important.}

She leaned back in the chair so she could get a look at the thermostat in the hallway.

\textit{Eighty-one degrees. Really? I must be running low today. When's the last time that I ate? Must be more than a week ago; I haven't moved from here in days.}

Returning her gaze to Kory, she peered at the freckles that were on his eyelids. They weren't visible when he was awake, but she loved looking at them while he skipped.

``I should continue my story about your dad, shouldn't I? I bet you're curious.

``Well, after the butcher shop encounter, we started bumping into each other more often. I'm pretty sure that he was secretly following me and `bumping' into me to have an excuse to talk.

``At length we started a beautiful courtship, though his mother wasn't the most lovely woman. She vehemently protested to Tom behind my back. It wasn't until much later in our marriage that Tom told me that she was deeply racist and didn't like me because she couldn't put her finger on where I was from. Naturally, that meant I wasn't English or French.

``Despite her protests, we were married. It was such a wonderful day; things couldn't have been more perfect. It was a clear Saturday; June 11, 1898. He wasn't a terribly large man, but he could command the attention of any space he entered. He stood about a half head taller than me and would envelop me with his soft eyes whenever we held each other.''

A longing sigh escaped her lips.

``Tom was my reason to continue. We were very happy together, and he adored me despite the visible trauma I carried. He continued being the loving, caring man that I had met at the butcher shop, except now he held me at the peak of his attention.

``Shortly after we were married, your dad became the owner of the brewery where he worked and life became a dream. Though he worked long hours, we wanted for nothing, save children.

``Luckily, we soon had that on the way as well. We found out in early 1901 that we were going to have a child.''

She took a moment to catch her breath as this much talking was exhausting what little energy she had.

``Of course, with any happy story, there comes a point where some unseen hand comes in to balance the scales. Nine months after we found out I was pregnant, you did not come, and so we waited.

``A few months later, we began to be very worried and went to see any specialist that promised to have an answer, though none could provide a suitable answer once they met us and our situation.

``Little seemed wrong, save the fact that you were taking so long to come into our lives. So, we patiently waited. Tom began cutting hours at the brewery so that he could be at home with me, should the time arrive.

``At long last, you decided to bless our lives on May 1, 1902. I believe that the pregnancy was about sixteen months, but you were perfect. Not a single thing wrong.

``Let's see,'' she said as she began doing some finger math with the hand that wasn't clasped around his. ``I think that would technically make you about... five hundred years old! Gee-whiz, that makes you an old man!''

She began to chuckle, but a stabbing pain in her chest stopped it short.

``You were such a blessing. A snotty, poopy, crying blessing, but a blessing nonetheless. Tom found every opportunity he could to hold you and to pamper you. Sometimes he went as far as to say you needed to be changed just so he could tear you away from me!

``However, the pendulum needed to swing back and with it, steal away our bliss. Just about a week after you came into our lives, you left; your first skip. At first, we thought you were sleeping, so we let you, but when you didn't wake up that evening, we panicked. You weren't breathing and were unresponsive to anything we did.''

Tears formed at the corner of her eyes, though she did not wipe them away.

``We rushed to any place that would see us at that hour, but that was few. Amidst the confusion and hurrying, you stayed warm and that gave us hope, so we continued our search all night and into the morning.

``At long last, a few hours from home, we found a doctor that would see us, but he told us that he had never heard of such a thing: a child in a perpetual, unbreathing sleep.

``When Tom and I had completely exhausted ourselves, we sat in a park and I told him that I believed you were alive. Despite it being a seemingly hopeless situation, I had a feeling that you would be okay.

``His soft green eyes sat deeply on my soul at that moment and he said, `Well, there's no doubting a mother's intuition,' and with that, we went home. What else could we do other than wait and trust that you were okay?''

With the back of her sweater sleeve, she removed the traces of tears from her face.

``To our surprise, you continued to stay warm, and so life continued on. I carried you around in my arms as much as I could and your dad carried you the rest of the time.

``In and out of years, you kept us waiting. Tom continued to build his business and reputation to the point that we were the wealthiest people for miles around. Despite his success, he always came home at the end of the day and would exuberantly declare `I'm here!' as he scooped you up in his arms.

``Slowly, but surely, just like all the other people in my life, Tom started to get old. He never gave up on you and believed that you would come back one day. Tom tried to be there for you when you woke, but in the end, he couldn't hold on anymore. It was November 23, 1943 when your dad passed away. He held on for fourty-one years. He believed, never wavering, for fourty-one years that you would wake up. That was such a hard day.''

She tried to repress her emotional scars, though it was futile.

``At his funeral, hundreds of people, extended family, work colleagues, business affiliates all arrived, though I knew next to none of them. We had largely kept to ourselves so that we could be there for you, so attending the viewing was like walking into a crowd of strangers.

``Given my appearance, many people assumed I was his daughter, holding his grandchild; not his wife. Person after person stabbed me as they expressed their condolences for my father.

``That night, I sobbed uncontrollably with you in my arms. The only thing that I could do was to continue to be there for you, as my reason to go on died that day, but my purpose lay in my arms.''

She extended her arm and stroked his hair. The sleek, unkempt hair ran through her dry hands. The sensation in her numbed hands caused her to wince.

``For the next twenty-seven years, I hardly moved or ate, curled up with you in our bedroom; nothing could disturb our living death.''

A slight ease came to her weary, green eyes, as she breathed and continued.

``It was June 4, 1970 when you finally woke up. I know because later that day I went outside to procure the paper. Your crying startled me so badly that I nearly dropped you. I held you close and cried, even though it hurt to move. The sound of your crying was music to my ears; it was a release from my personal hell that I never expected to escape.

``Words hardly do justice when I tell you I was stunned to see how the world had changed in all those years of waiting. The next few weeks were spent running around, trying to find ways to take care of you in this new world.

``I found that wet nurses were no longer a thing and that they now had milk banks. People no longer relied on the newspaper for their news; instead they used something completely foreign to me called radios.''

She looked over at all the electronics scattered about Kory's room and smirked at the irony.

``Even though Tom wasn't there to hold you, he's the one that is still carrying us both. In his lifetime, he became very successful and invested his fortune instead of living lavishly, as his business partners did. Tom had a plan: he was going to care for you one way or another.''

It had been a very long time since she had talked this much and she was parched.

\textit{Kory's not going to mind if I drink his water. I'll make sure I fill it up before long.}

Taking an enthusiastic gulp, she nearly coughed it up.

``Tom was an amazing man. \textit{Your dad} was an amazing man.'' She released a heavy breath. ``I'm sorry, Kory. All this talking has made me very tired. I'm just going to shut my eyes for a bit, but I want you to know, I'm here.''
