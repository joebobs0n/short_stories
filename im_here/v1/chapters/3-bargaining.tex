\chapter*{Bargaining}
%! tries to understand if there's a way that he can live without the consequences of his condition
%! namely through time travelling backwards and talks through the implications/possibilities with his mom
%! eventually comes to the conclusion that it's too dangerous as it's too unknown

what kinds of backward time travel issues are there?

\begin{itemize}
    \item altering the future (back to the future)
    \item creating an alternate future (multiverse theory) so when you return to the ``present,'' it's no longer a one to one mapping, returning is uncertain which universe you will get
    \item go ``back in time,'' but actually just moving to another parallel universe and then going forward you are in the wrong universe
    \item go back and you already exist
    \begin{itemize}
        \item you can't come close to yourself for fear of temporal paradox
        \item coming in close to yourself has no issues
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
