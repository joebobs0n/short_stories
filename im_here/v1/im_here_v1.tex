% synopsys: two lifelong friends, one with time travel abilities and the other seemingly immortal, get locked into fates worse than death

% notes:
% mother:
    % Name: Chelsea Jacobsen
    % Power: immortality, but does not mean invulnerability. she feels pain more sharply than others, and heals significantly slower. additionally, her metabolism is about half as fast as normal peoples' (body temperature is 81 deg F). she also stopped physically aging in her 30s.
% son:
    % Name: Korinth Jacobsen, Kory for short, but mother often calls her little king (reference to Sisyphus who was the king of Corinth who was forced to push a rock up a hill endlessly for his sin of cheating death multiple times)
    % Power: time travel, but has limited control over it (another parallel to pushing the rock?)

%! arcane/cryptic prose about the futility of living forever (get reader to believe that it's about the mother)
%! somehow hint at it being one of the post-its from "thy cup runneth over"

\begin{displayquote}

    Query not the desires of man, to hold aloft alien constructs. You know not what you desire, yet that is what you seek. We are naught. THEY are all. THEY are grand. To catch the pearls of eternity is to bear new shackles for we are slaves to Grandfather Time.

    Die today for tomorrow is yesterday. Die today and relinquish your meat to his feast. Grandfather Time laughs. He gorges on all. Live and be spoiled. Live and be subject to He Who Holds.
