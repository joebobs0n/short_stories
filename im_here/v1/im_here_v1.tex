    % Power:
% son:
    % Name: Korynth, Kory for short, but mother often calls her little king (reference to Sisyphus who was the king of Corinth who was forced to push a rock up a hill endlessly for his sin of cheating death multiple times)
    % Power: time travel, but has limited control over it (another parallel to pushing the rock?)

How long had it been? She opened her eyes to the gaunt arms stretched in front of her. In their hands were her little king's warm hands. Were these her arms? How long \textit{had} it been? She didn't even recognize her own limbs.

Then the sharp stabbing pain of hunger threw her into convulsions as her stomach wretched to expell anything, though nothing came. Curled over, she gasped for air between convulsions, though she made sure to not release Kory's hands. She had to be here if he woke up.

Slowly her gut settled and just the gnawing pain of emaciation remained. Raising her heavy head, she looked upon her son. He looked exactly as he always had, not a single thing wrong, just as though he were asleep. His tawny, roughly cut hair lay to one side and the mild scruff that lay upon his face reminded her of his father. When had her little boy grown up?
