\chapter*{The Old Woman}

% an old woman in a small secluded town (unbeknownst to the villagers) transports people once coming
% of age to an alternate dimension that is a disturbing mockery of the town and life they once had

A week's journey by foot past the end of the dirt trail outside Langton would bring you to the small
town of Gransford. Far from any man's wishes or desires, here, nestled amongst the fishing
cliffs, a small community resilient in traditions and superstitions refueses to be snuffed from
existence.

I was born in this town, but then again, everyone else shared a similar fate. As far as I can
remember, no one ever visited and no one ever left; at least before the age fourty. Life is
relatively mundane as the Jeswalops and Grishams rarely had tussles anymore. William was always the
trouble maker and loved the tussles. I personally think that he did it to break up the monotony of
day to day life. He never was one for fishing. Something about the ten pound sinker we had to attach
to the lines rubbed him the wrong way. Once I made the mistake of speaking to him on a fishing trip
and he threatened to use me as the sinker instead.

Despite all his murmurings, not even he would ever question lady Yağmur. She didn't have a last name
and seemed to be as neutral in all things as her appearance. She never took sides, but gave advice
and council fairly. It was all to be expected, however, being the eldest person in the town, but by
how much, no one knew. All of the adults would steal themselves away to the neighboring towns upon
their fourtieth birthdays to experience the outside world. Lady Yağmur was special as she was the
only person to love the town enough to return after her venture. I expect William ran the week's
journey to the dirt trail leading to Langton and from there never looked back. He hated this place.
Many people hated this place, but we were warned that outside was no place for us fledgling souls.

We were all warned from an early age that the outside world was beautifl and magnificent, but was
not to be taken lightly for all its gaudy brilliance, a wretched underbelly stood waiting to enslave
the timid and weak. For this reason, at the ripe age of fourty, lady Yağmur would give her blessing
and send each person, armed with knowledge and blessing, into the outside world for their maturity
gave them a fortitude of mind to withstand.

Would I return to Gransford after seeing the outside world or would I be ensared by my lust for
riches of mind and body? I hoped that I wouldn't for that was the way to damnation. I'm sure that I
would return. I would be strong. I would look up on that world and know that I have the virtue of
the holy knights of old. But, what of my mother? Was she not devout to the traditions of our
village? I heard from others that in my infantile years, she would often return from fishing trips
at the cliffs with baskets of fish for all. Lady Yağmur would say that she was fertile beyond
compare and it was thanks to her devotion to the innocence of Gransford. She even received a greater
medallion to harness her virtues. Despite all this, why did my mother, of all people, not return
from the outer lands?

I soon would celebrate another celestial elipse and would be one more year closer to my fourtieth
year. I too would receive blessing and knowledge and be sent into the embrace of tempation. Despite
brandishing a smaller medallion, I believe that deep down, I have drive that is yet secret to the
eye of Yağmur. Should I happen upon my mother in my ventures, I will bring her back, much like the
knights of old with their chivalric honors, to restore her innocence and peace.

``Jarom!''

Startling awake from my terse ruminations, I found Zachary Edison grasping my rod, keeping it from
falling great distance to the waters below.

``You going to stop day dreaming about Jennifer and help me bring in your libation?''

``Uh, yeah. Sorry.''

After a small quarrel and a few minutes of reeling, a smaller than average fish was added to my dry
basket.

``So, how was it?''

``How was what?''

``You know. Your daydream? About Jennifer?''

``Don't be distasteful. I wasn't thinking anything weird about Jennifer.''

``Why not? You two did get married just a month ago. If not thinking about her, then what?''

``Would you leave me alone if I told you that you were right? That I was thinking weird things about
my... wife?'' The word still felt sticky coming from my tongue. I did wait quite a bit longer to get
married than most of the other men in the village, who typically were wed by their twenty-second
birthday. Being so much older, I also had to marry a girl quite a bit younger than myself, and I
felt that Zachary was just a little jealous.

``No. I would not. Now that you were obviously thinking about something else. I swear, I would do
nothing but think of my little thing if I married a young thing like that. So what was it?''

``Do you oft think about the outside world and whether you'll come back to Gransford?''

``Not really. I hate this place. And I don't particularly care for old lady Yağmur either. I'll
likely get whatever knowledge she has for me and depart with my family at my heel.''

``Come on, you can't do that to your kids. They're not old enough and will surely sucumb to
something.''

``Bah. I'd take care of them. You know that. I'd never let anything happen to my boys.''

``I certainly hope so. For your sake. Can you image how upset lady Yağmur is going to be when she
realizes that you took your family before they reached the age of maturity?''

``Frankly, I don't care, because there's no chance that I, or my family, will ever return.''

``Well, it's getting dark. We should take our fish back for the libation ceremony.''

``Yeah, I guess. Always hated this ceremony. I don't like the way lady Yağmur blinks during it.''
